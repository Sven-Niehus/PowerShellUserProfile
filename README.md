# PowerShell User Profile

This is my PowerShell User profile that I use every day. The source code for PowerShell is in the [PSProfile](PSProfile/) folder and symlinked to the [PowerShell](PowerShell/) and [WindowsPowerShell](WindowsPowerShell/) folder. 

The repository also includes some [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) source code in the [AHK](AHK/) folder which, at this time, is primarily for making the Microsoft Teams keyboard shortcuts global.
